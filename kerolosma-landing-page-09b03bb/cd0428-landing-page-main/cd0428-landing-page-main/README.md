## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
Project Description
This project is a simple landing page that showcases the use of manipulating the DOM using JavaScript. The page consists of three sections, each containing some text that demonstrates how to change the style of the HTML elements using JavaScript.

Usage
To view the page, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The page is responsive and can be viewed on desktop and mobile devices.

Dependencies
The page does not require any external dependencies to run. However, it uses Google Fonts and a CSS file to style the page.

Manipulating the DOM
The app.js file contains JavaScript code that dynamically generates the navigation menu based on the sections available in the HTML. It also adds an event listener to the menu items so that when a user clicks on a menu item, the corresponding section is scrolled into view.

The JavaScript code also adds a scroll listener to the window object, which checks which section is currently in view and adds an active class to the corresponding menu item and section. This allows the user to see which section is currently being viewed.

The CSS file contains styles for the page elements, including the navigation menu, section headers, and section content. The styles change dynamically based on the user's interactions with the page.
